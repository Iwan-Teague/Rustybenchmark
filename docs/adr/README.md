# Architecture Decision Records

One file per decision that was genuinely contested, including the ones that were made and then reversed during the exploratory phase.

Format: context, options, decision, consequences. Reversals keep the original reasoning visible rather than editing history — the reason a decision was reversed is usually more informative than the decision itself.
