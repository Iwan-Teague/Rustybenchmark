//! The `trait-impl` family (category `traits-generics`).
//!
//! A task shape whose *distinctive* skill is implementing a **trait with an
//! associated type** for a provided type, consumed by a **generic driver with a
//! where-bound**. The interface is pinned in the skeleton (like `error-handling`
//! pins its enum): the trait `Aggregate`, the generic function
//! `fn driver<A: Aggregate<Item = i64>>(agg: &A, xs: &[i64]) -> i64`, and a unit
//! struct are all given; the model writes the `impl Aggregate for … { type Item =
//! i64; … }` block. Getting the associated type or a method signature wrong makes
//! the driver's `A: Aggregate<Item = i64>` bound unsatisfiable, so the hidden
//! tests fail to build and the answer scores zero — which is exactly the
//! "L1 + signature match" emphasis docs/04 assigns this category.
//!
//! The reduction the model must implement is seed-selected on two axes:
//!
//! 1. **Keep** — which elements are folded: Positive / Even / NonNegative / Odd.
//! 2. **Reduce** — how kept elements combine: Sum / Product / Count / SumOfSquares
//!    / SumOfAbs (each with its identity).
//!
//! The structural surface is 4 × 5 = **20 distinct skills**. Solution-first and
//! correct-by-construction (ADR-0003): the native `eval` and the emitted `impl`
//! are mirrored, and the differential fuzzes 3000 random slices against the
//! driver. Input values are kept small (∈ -9..=9, length 0..12) so no legal input
//! overflows `i64` in a debug build — the tightest case is `Product` over eleven
//! `9`s (9¹¹ ≈ 3.1e10, far below `i64::MAX`).
