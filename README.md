# Rustybenchmark

A benchmark harness for measuring what **local LLMs can actually do in Rust**, and what **your specific machine** can deliver while doing it.

Two numbers that do not currently exist side by side anywhere:

- **Capability** — what a model can solve, time-unbounded, broken down by Rust skill area (borrow checker, traits, unsafe, async, idiom, perf, …).
- **Throughput** — what a given machine + model + quantisation combination actually delivers per hour, per GB of VRAM, per watt-hour.

Every run profiles the host, calibrates inference on it, runs a seeded, contamination-resistant task suite in a sandbox, grades with a layered oracle, and (opt-in) submits redacted results to a public leaderboard.

Written in Rust. Runs on consumer hardware. Talks to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio).

## Status

**Building — the generation + grading + aggregation half works end to end (macOS).** The design phase (17 docs, 10 ADRs, 6 adversarial review rounds) is under `docs/`. Code follows the roadmap in [docs/14-roadmap.md](docs/14-roadmap.md); phases P0 (spine), P1 (sandbox), P2 (oracle depth), P3 (generation) and much of P4 (runs, resume, stats) have landed.

**What runs today.** `rustybench run` sends a task — a hand-frozen file or a **seed-generated** one — to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, grades the response with the real `cargo`/`rustc` toolchain inside a sandbox, and writes a scored JSONL journal line. `run-suite` serves a whole resumable epoch (paired-core + fresh-probe seeds); `stats` folds a journal into capability, pass-rate and cluster-bootstrap CIs; `status` gives progress/ETA. Tasks are generated *solution-first* so the oracle is correct by construction; **thirteen families across ten categories** now generate memorisation-measured, correct-by-construction tasks.

```
crates/
  bench-core        types, scoring, rustc-code → FailureClass       (pure, no I/O)
  bench-gen         seed → task (13 families) · anti-twin + spec-diversity · epoch sampler
  bench-oracle      L0 apply · L1 compile · L2 behavior/differential · L3 syn AST + clippy
  bench-sandbox     macOS seatbelt: no network, confined writes, wall-clock kill
  bench-model       OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions client
  bench-stats       journal → capability · pass-rate · wild cluster bootstrap · McNemar · ICC · throughput
  bench-cli         run · run-suite · validate-family · stats · compare · detect · status
  bench-invariants  CI gate: recomputes every published statistic
```

Build and try it:

```bash
cargo test                                                                    # 166 tests across the crates
cargo run -p bench-cli -- validate-family --family idiom-loop --seeds 8        # prove a family's generator is sound
cargo run -p bench-cli -- run --family error-handling --seed 42 --model http://localhost:8080
```

**OS:** grading runs sandboxed on **macOS** (seatbelt). Linux/Windows containment is not built yet (roadmap gate G1).

Landed since P3: the statistics layer (`bench-stats` — capability, pass-rate, studentised wild cluster-bootstrap CIs, McNemar, the precomputation sign test, ICC, throughput), the run protocol (epoch orchestration, resume, `status`, `segment_position` + cache-warmth exclusion), and the Q28/Q29 decisions behind them (the structural pass predicate; the estimation spec). Still to come, per the roadmap: hardware profiling and upload (P1 hw / P6); the full 272-family corpus (P7), of which **13** exist across 10 categories — **all 5 core categories are now covered** (`unsafe-core` grades without miri until P7); L4 quality (mutation/perf); and the mined `wild` suite.

Supporting:

- **[docs/REVIEW.md](docs/REVIEW.md)** — adversarial review round 1. Read this alongside the docs it corrects; several published figures were wrong and the category design changed as a result
- **[docs/REVIEW-2.md](docs/REVIEW-2.md)** — adversarial review round 2, empirical against rustc 1.97. Found a direct contradiction between the statistical and integrity designs, and measured the diagnostic instrumentation to be blind for a third of realistic failures
- **[docs/REVIEW-3.md](docs/REVIEW-3.md)** — adversarial review round 3. Settled four deferred questions empirically; two settled against the design. `cargo clippy --fix` solves part of a core category, and the frozen plan could not hold probe units
- **[docs/REVIEW-4.md](docs/REVIEW-4.md)** — adversarial review round 4. The precomputation detector is defeated by an adversary willing to fail units deliberately; seed secrecy replaces it as the primary control. Also records a near-miss simplification that two simulations disagreed about
- **[docs/REVIEW-6.md](docs/REVIEW-6.md)** — adversarial review round 6. 72 findings, 23 verified. The statistical machinery cannot be built as specified: `task_score` is continuous, McNemar is a binary test, and no pass predicate exists anywhere — so `throughput_score` is uncomputable. **Unevenly verified; read its first section before acting on it**
- **[docs/REVIEW-5.md](docs/REVIEW-5.md)** — adversarial review round 5. 58 findings, 21 severe. Invalidates round 4's pairing result and with it the entire secrecy architecture; the mining pipeline and the plausibility checks do not work as specified. **Read R5-S1 first**

## The one-paragraph version

Static coding benchmarks rot: models memorise them. Rustybenchmark ships **generators**, not answers. Each task family is a function from a seed to a fresh problem instance, its reference implementation, and its property-based oracle — all constructed from the same seed, so the oracle is correct by construction and the instance has never been seen. Grading is deterministic given the seed, which means the server can independently re-verify any submitted correctness claim. Hardware claims cannot be verified, so they are reported separately and at a lower trust level. Runs checkpoint continuously and resume across sessions, because the largest suite takes around 44.5 hours on consumer hardware.

## License

**Two licences, deliberately.** The harness is noncommercial; the *data it produces* is not, because
independent re-derivation is the project's strongest integrity control and most of the parties with
the motive to audit a row are commercial.

- **Published results corpus → [CC BY 4.0](DATA-LICENSE.md).** Anyone may download the dump,
  recompute the leaderboard, and build on the data, commercially or not.
- **Harness and synthetic task corpus → [PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](LICENSE.md)** — free for any noncommercial purpose, including
personal, research, educational, and charitable use. Commercial use requires a separate licence;
open an issue.

Two things this deliberately does **not** restrict, because the benchmark's credibility depends on
them:

- **Reading, auditing, and re-deriving results.** Anyone may download the published corpus and
  recompute the leaderboard. That is the strongest integrity control the project has
  ([docs/10-integrity.md](docs/10-integrity.md)) and no licence term is allowed to weaken it.
- **Publishing findings.** Independent analysis of published data is not a licensed use of the
  software and is not restricted.

**The `wild` mined corpus is not covered by this licence.** Those task families derive from
third-party repositories under their own licences, which cannot be relicensed. They will carry
per-source attribution and terms, tracked in [docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md](docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) Q1.
